# ACL Unity

This is a Unity Native Plugin which wraps a subset of
[ACL](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl). Its primary purpose is for use in
DOTS-based projects.

## About ACL

Animation Compression Library, or ACL, is a C++11 library written by Nicholas
Frechette and has been utilized in multiple AAA titles. It uses variable
bit-rate compression of fixed-rate sampled poses for fast and highly accurate
compression and decompression of both short and long clips. It is
hierarchy-aware, further increasing its accuracy. It supports many platforms and
can be compiled to utilize various levels of SIMD instructions.

## About this Unity Plugin

Nicholas Frechette maintains an official Unreal Engine plugin. However, due to
the closed-source nature of traditional Unity, he does not develop an equivalent
for Unity.

This is an unofficial plugin for Unity primarily targeting DOTS-based projects.
I (Dreaming381) wrote this wrapper for the needs of the [Latios
Framework](https://github.com/Dreaming381/Latios-Framework). But feel free to
use it or improve it as you see fit.

## Why ACL and DOTS?

Traditionally, Unity uses curves for animation. It achieves performance by
caching parts of the curve evaluation for use in the next evaluation. However,
this approach doesnâ€™t work as well in a DOTS project, where statelessness is
preferred. ACL uses a technique that does not require caches to persist between
frames in order to achieve great performance. It is also developed with a
data-oriented mindset and API, making integration relatively straightforward.

If you are considering using this in your own DOTS-based animation solution,
consider storing compressed tracks in BlobArrays with forced 16-byte alignment,
and calling directly into this plugin from Burst jobs.
